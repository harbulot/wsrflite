Test Scripts for checking services are working OK. They are used 
when developing WSRF::Lite. 

signature_checker.pl is used to create and validate a signed
SOAP message using WS-Security - simply run the script. The
script has lots of comments explaining what is going on.

wsrftest.pl is used to test a WSRF::Lite Container is working
properly. It can be use to check a container that is using
either HTTP or HTTPS. The script checks WSRF WS-Resources that
use either one process per WS-Resource, one process multiple
WS-Resources or WS-Resources that use a file to store state.
Simply run the script to find out the command line options,
at the prompt type a number from 1-9 to run a particular test.
The script assumes the WSRF::Lite Container is listing to port
50000 on the localhost


client_test.pl is used to test the client scripts in the
client scripts directory of WSRF::Lite - it runs each script
against a WSRF::Lite Container that is assumed to be listening
to port 50000 on localhost. There are 29 tests associated with 
this script. Simply run the script to run the tests.

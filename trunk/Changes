Revision history for Perl extension WSRF-Lite.

For previous changes prior to version 0.8.2.3, please read README

0.8.2.4
	* bug fixes:
	   - old XPATH expressions didnt work with XML::LibXML; removed the <XPATH ...> elements and left the actual expression
	   - wrapped some of the canonicalization code in evals so that we dont die everytime an expression doesnt match
	- added a $WSRF::TIME::EXPIRES_IN variable so that resources dont always expire in 3600 seconds. 
	

0.8.2.3
    - first cpan release
    - swapped XML::CanonicalizeXML for XML::LibXML
    - makefile now downloads missing dependencies

WSRF::Lite implements, in Perl, the Web Service Resource Framework (WSRF) which was inspired by and supersedes the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI).

This project was originally developed by Mark Mc Keown at the University of Manchester. Please visit the [WSRF::Lite home page](http://www.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/research/wsrflite) for more details.
